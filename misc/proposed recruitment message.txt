As part of my graduate program at UC Berkeley, I am part of a team conducting an academic research study. Please consider taking a few minutes to help us with this project!

We are conducting a survey about animal identification. It is fun and easy to do. You will be shown pictures of 10 animals and asked to identify each one. It takes most people about 5 minutes to complete!

You can participate by visiting this link: http://goo.gl/dyGfp1

We'd like as many people as possible to participate in this study, so please help spread the word by sharing this post with as many people as you can!
